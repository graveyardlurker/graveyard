					<h2>That's Not My Cousin</h2>
					<hr />
					<p>When I was about ten or eleven-years-old, I was living in a small town in Pennsylvania. My sister, mom and I were temporarily living with my aunt.</p>
					<p>One night, my uncle of no blood relation got mad at my cousin for something of which I cannot remember. Anyway, my cousin then stormed outside and</p>
					<p>slammed the door behind him, a loud bang echoing throughout the house. Fast forward to about thirty minutes later, and I hear my cousin's voice from</p>
					<p>upstairs. He yelled my name and said, "Come up here! I have a new video game!" I then promptly went up the staircase, and ran into his room. However, I</p>
					<p>neglected to remember that he hadn't come back inside yet from thirty minutes earlier. As I neared the room, I peaked in and saw that the room was</p>
					<p>empty. I checked all over that room, and no, he definitely was not in there. A feeling of dread overcame me, and I then booked it back downstairs.</p>
					<p>Once I reached the bottom, I saw my cousin was then back inside. To this day, I don't know what called me up there, and to be honest, I don't care to</p>
					<p>know. Some things are better left alone.</p>
