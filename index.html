					<h2>The Time I Was Almost Kidnapped</h2>
					<hr />
					<p>In my previous story, I meantioned the small town in Pennsylvania; well, in this story, it was a year or two later. I was playing outside one</p>
					<p>day--November of that year, I believe--when these two teenagers walked down the alley outside my apartment. If I had to guess their ages, I'd</p>
					<p>assume sixteen or seventeen-years-old at the most. As they walked down the alley, one of them shouted, "Hey!" I looked up to face them, happy</p>
					<p>someone was being friendly. I walked up to them a bit until they met me, and we started talking. I cannot remember the exact conversation, sadly, but</p>
					<p>it is not required for this story, I suppose. Anyway, at some point while talking, I noticed they started moving toward the sidewalk at the end of</p>
					<p>the alleyway. As embarrassed as I am to admit this, I started walking with them. A minute or two into the walk, full of chatter, one of the guys</p>
					<p>leaned to the other and asked, "How far are we taking this kid away from his home?" I stopped, realized the situation, and ran. I ran so fast, it</p>
					<p>felt like I reached my apartment building in ten seconds. I ran up the stairs, enetered my apartment, and locked the door. I never told anyone close</p>
					<p>to me about this experience until very recently, but it happened so long ago that there was basically no reaction. I feel like me, telling this story, helps</p>
					<p>to cope with it. If you find yourself in a dangerous situation, it doesn't matter if you realize a *bit* late; better late than never, as they say.</p>

					<h2>That's Not My Cousin</h2>
					<hr />
					<p>When I was about ten or eleven-years-old, I was living in a small town in Pennsylvania. My sister, mom and I were temporarily living with my aunt.</p>
					<p>One night, my uncle got mad at my cousin for something of which I cannot remember. Anyway, my cousin then stormed outside and</p>
					<p>slammed the door behind him, a loud bang echoing throughout the house. Fast forward to about thirty minutes later, and I hear my cousin's voice from</p>
					<p>upstairs. He yelled my name and said, "Come up here! I have a new video game!" I then promptly went up the staircase, and ran into his room. However, I</p>
					<p>neglected to remember that he hadn't come back inside yet from thirty minutes earlier. As I neared the room, I peaked in and saw that the room was</p>
					<p>empty. I checked all over that room, and no, he definitely was not in there. A feeling of dread overcame me, and I then booked it back downstairs.</p>
					<p>Once I reached the bottom, I saw my cousin was then back inside. To this day, I don't know what called me up there, and to be honest, I don't care to</p>
					<p>know. Some things are better left alone.</p>
